- [ ] Re-write on the web so I can share with Gabe and others.

- [ ] Purchase minebot
    - [ ] Show minebot count
    - [ ] Show minebot rate (start at 1)
    - [ ] add `(mining rate * minebot rate) / seconds since last tick`
- [ ] Purchase assemblybot
    - [ ] Show assemblybot count
    - [ ] Show assemblybot rate (start at 1)
    - [ ] add `(assembly rate * assemblybot rate) / seconds since last tick`
- [ ] Some way to increase effiency (by 0.1 to start). Purchase assembly training?

Future ideas:
- [ ] Visual silos for ore and aglets
- [ ] Max out silos. Purchase bigger silos.
- [ ] Purchase salesman: Auto-sell aglets when silo full.
